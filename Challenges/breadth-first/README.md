# breadth-first traversal
Implement breadth-first traversal

## Challenge
* Write a breadth first traversal method which takes a Binary Tree as its unique input.
Traverse the input tree using a breadth-first approach; print every visited nodeâ€™s value.

## Approach & Efficiency

*  `bfs_tree()` utilizing implemented earlier class Queue and it's methods:
* enqueue()
O(1)
* dequeue(()
O(1)
* peek()
O(1)
