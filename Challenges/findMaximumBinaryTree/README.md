# findMaximumBinaryTree
Implement breadth-first traversal

[PR LINK](https://github.com/NadyaIlinskiy/data-structures-and-algorithms-2/pull/20)

## Challenge
* Write a class function called find-maximum-value. It returns max value stored n the Binary Tree.
(assumption is that all the values are numeric).

## Approach & Efficiency
 
 `findMaximumBinaryTree` class extends BinaryTree class and utilizing utilizing 
 breadth first traversal method implemented earlier
Efficiency - O(n) as it's going though every Node
