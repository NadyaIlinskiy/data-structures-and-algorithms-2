# “FizzBuzz” on a tree 
Conduct “FizzBuzz” on a tree while traversing through it. Change the values of each of the nodes dependent on the current node’s value.

## Challenge
* Write a function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a tree’s root Node as an argument.
* This tree can be any binary tree with number values on its Nodes
* Without utilizing any built-in methods available in JavaScript, determine whether or not the value of each Node is divisible by 3 and/or 5 and change the value of each of the nodes:
    * If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
    * If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
    * If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
    * Return the tree with its new values.

## Approach & Efficiency
* O(n) - where n= number of Nodes in Tree
