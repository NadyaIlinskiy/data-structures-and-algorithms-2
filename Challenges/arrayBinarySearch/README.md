# Array binary search
Array binary search with Java Script

## Challenge
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

## Approach & Efficiency
# TODO: update Approach & Efficiency
* Approach implemented in incertShift function is efficient as it only reqires one cycle and incert and shift given array in place in two steps:
    1. Adding new element to the end of the array via .push js funciton
    2. Starting from the last element of the array function iterates swapping elements of the array in place until it reaches given index (in this case (arr.length)/2 works for both kind of array - with even & odd number of values). 
* There's helper funciton swap implemented in spirit of functional programming to make main function cleaner.
* Similar approch used in removeShiftArray function (reverced incertShift) - in this case I've implemented is / else statment to accomodate arrays with odd & even numbers of values.
