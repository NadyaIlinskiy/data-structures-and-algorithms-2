# HashTable
Implement a HashTable Data Structure

## Challenge
* Implement a Hashtable with the following methods:

    * `add`: takes in both a key and a value. This function should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.
    * `get`: takes in the key and returns the value from the table.
    * `contains`: takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
    * `hash`: takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.


## Approach & Efficiency
There're three methods implemented in the class LinkedList:
#### Binary Tree
* add(); 
O(n)
* get();
O(1)
* contains();
O(1)
* hash()
O(n)
