# Stack and Queue
Implement a Stack and a Queue Data Structure

## Challenge
* Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next node.
* Create a Stack class that has a top property. It creates an empty Stack when instantiated.

* * This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to top when the stack is created.
Define a method called push which takes any value as an argument and adds a new Node with that value to the top of the stack with an O(1) time performance.
* * Define a method called pop that does not take any arguments and removes the Node from the top of the stack, and returns that popped Node’s value.
* * Define a method called peek that does not take an argument and returns the value of the node located on top of the stack, without removing it from the stack.


* Create a Queue class that has a front and rear property. It creates an empty Queue when instantiated.

* * This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to front when the queue is created.
* * Define a method called enqueue which takes any value as an argument and adds a new Node with that value to the rear of the queue with an O(1) time performance.
* * Define a method called dequeue that does not take any arguments and removes the Node from the front of the queue, and returns the Node’s value.
* * Define a method called peek that does not take any arguments and returns the value of the Node located in the front of the queue, without removing it from the queue.


## Approach & Efficiency
There're three methods implemented in the class LinkedList:
#### Stack
* push(); 
O(1)
* pop();
O(1)
* peek();
O(1)
* print()
O(n)

#### Queue
* enqueue()
O(1)
* dequeue(()
O(1)
* peek()
O(1)
* print()
O(n)
